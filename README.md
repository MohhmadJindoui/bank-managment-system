# Bank Management System – Java OOP

A simple yet structured **Bank Management System** implemented in **Java**,  
demonstrating core **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.

This project was developed as part of academic practice in software design and Java programming.

##  Project Overview

The system simulates basic bank operations including:
- Managing bank accounts
- Handling customers and bank employees
- Performing transactions
- Generating reports

The focus of the project is **clean OOP design**, not UI.

- `BankManager` – Manages bank-level operations
- `BankManagement` – Central system logic
- `Program` – Entry point (main method)

### Interfaces
- `Transactable` – Defines transaction behavior
- `Reportable` – Defines reporting capabilities

## OOP Concepts Used

- Encapsulation  
- Inheritance  
- Polymorphism
